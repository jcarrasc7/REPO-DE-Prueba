# Iris Species Classification Dashboard

The interactive dashboard was created in Streamlit, which was first developed in Google Colab, then linked to GitHub, and finally the interactive panel was implemented in Streamlit based on the instructions provided by the professor.

# Description
This project is part of the Machine Learning Classification activity.  
The goal is to analyze the Iris dataset, train a predictive model, and display visualizations, model metrics, and an interactive species prediction panel.

# Features

- Upload of the Iris.csv dataset.
- Automatic training of a Random Forest classifier.
- Model performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Visualizations:
  1. 3D scatter plot showing the dataset grouped by species.
  2. Visualization of the predicted point inside the 3D scatter.
- Manual prediction panel where the user inputs sepal/petal measurements and receives the predicted species.

# Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit  

To run the app:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
streamlit run app.py
